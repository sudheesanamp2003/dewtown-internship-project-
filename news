        Jonathan Majors' conviction for assaulting and harassing his ex-girlfriend, Grace Jabbari, prompted Marvel Studios to drop him from his role as the supervillain Kang, in its upcoming superhero films. Majors' is not the first MCU star to face the axe for his controversies. From director James Gunn to Spider-Man star Andrew Garfield, here's a list of celebs who were fired from Marvel films for reasons ranging from legal battles to controversial social media comments. there were no reports or credible sources indicating that Jonathan Majors or Andrew Garfield were fired from Marvel movies. However, it's essential to note that information about the entertainment industry can change rapidly, and new developments may have occurred since then.</p>

        <p>Jonathan Majors is known for his role as Kang the Conqueror in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), making his debut in the Disney+ series "Loki." Andrew Garfield, on the other hand, played the role of Spider-Man in Sony's "The Amazing Spider-Man" series before being replaced by Tom Holland in the MCU's portrayal of the character.</p>
        
        <p>If there have been any recent developments or changes in the status of these actors in the Marvel universe, I recommend checking the latest news sources or official statements from Marvel Studios for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
